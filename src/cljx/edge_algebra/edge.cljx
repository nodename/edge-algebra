;; First we give the eight primitive operations
;; that find the next and prev edges through
;; each of the four rings in which this edge participates.
;; Note that they all access a single property of
;; the Edge type, .getNext:

;; find the QuadEdge immediately following this one
;; counterclockwise in the ring of edges out of originVertex:
(defn ^:private onext [edge]
  (get-edge (get-edge-record (:next edge))
                                       (:r (:next edge)) (:f (:next edge))))

;; find the QuadEdge immediately following this one
;; clockwise in the ring of edges out of originVertex:
(def ^:private oprev (comp rot onext rot))

;; find the QuadEdge immediately following this one
;; counterclockwise in the ring of edges into destVertex:
(def ^:private dnext (comp sym onext sym))

;; find the QuadEdge immediately following this one
;; clockwise in the ring of edges into destVertex:
(def ^:private dprev (comp #(rot -1 %) onext #(rot -1 %)))

;; find the next counterclockwise QuadEdge with the same left face:
(def ^:private lnext (comp rot onext #(rot -1 %)))

;; find the next clockwise QuadEdge with the same left face:
(def ^:private lprev (comp sym onext))

;; find the next clockwise QuadEdge with the same right face:
(def ^:private rnext (comp #(rot -1 %) onext rot))

;; find the next clockwise QuadEdge with the same right face:
(def ^:private rprev (comp onext sym))

;; Now we develop the interfaces to these operations
;; that allow an exponent indicating how many steps (positive or negative)
;; to traverse the respective rings:
