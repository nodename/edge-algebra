;; ## A data structure for generalized diagrams
;;
;; "Generalized diagrams -- that is, embeddings of graphs in two-dimensional
;; manifolds. This structure represents simultaneously an embedding, its dual,
;; and its mirror image. Furthermore, just two operators are sufficient
;; for building and modifying arbitrary diagrams."
;;
;; ## Some Topology
;;
;; "In mathematics, the closure of a subset S in a topological space
;; consists of all points in S plus the limit points of S. The closure of S
;; is also defined as the union of S and its boundary." -- Wikipedia
;;
;; Homeomorphisms are the isomorphisms in the category of topological spaces.
